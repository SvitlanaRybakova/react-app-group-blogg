        If you don’t, then you’ve come to the right place. In 1994, when blogs
        began, a blog was more of a personal diary that people shared online. In
        this online journal, you could talk about your daily life or share about
        things that you were doing. Then, people saw an opportunity to
        communicate information in a new way online. Thus began the beautiful
        world of blogging. There are many reasons to start a blog for personal
        use and only a handful of strong ones for business blogging. Blogging
        for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has
        a very straightforward purpose – to rank your website higher in Google
        SERPs, a.k.a. increase your visibility. As a business, you rely on
        consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business,
        you rely on blogging to help you get to potential consumers and grab
        their attention. Without blogging, your website would remain invisible,
        whereas running a blog makes you searchable and competitive. Lorem
